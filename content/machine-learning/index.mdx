# Understanding Machine Learning

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It revolves around the idea that machines can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data, mapping input variables to the desired output. Common algorithms include linear regression and classification techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Decision Trees.

```javascript
// Example of supervised learning using JavaScript

// Load the model
const model = new SVMModel();

// Train the model with labeled data
model.train(trainingData);

// Make predictions
const result = model.predict(newData);
console.log(result);
```
